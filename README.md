- If there are any questions, feel free to record any assumptions made.

## Details

- use React for rendering the HTML list and button ui
- use the Flux data flow pattern (you may use Redux or any other Flux library)
- code must be unit tested, adhere to sound software engineering principles and be self documenting code
- code must be written using ES2016/ES2017, enable any options you like in Babel
- all articles have unique ids, titles and images. one article tile/teaser is:
```js
{
    id: 1,
    title: "article title 1",
    image: "http://placehold.it/300x250&text=image 1"
}
```
